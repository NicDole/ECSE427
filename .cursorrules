# Function Documentation Format

Use `/** */` block comments for function and API descriptions (e.g. in headers and above function definitions). Structure:

```c
/**
 * Brief description ending with period.
 *
 * Optional detailed description paragraph.
 *
 * @param name Description
 * @return Description
 */
```

Rules: Blank line after brief, blank line before @param/@return, blank line between tags. No @brief tag.

# Code Comments Style (inline)

Use `//` only for inline code comments, and only when the comment fits on one line.

- In implementation files (.c), add concise one-line `//` comments to explain logic.
- Comment global variables, key operations, edge cases, important decisions.
- Don't repeat header documentation.
- Keep comments short and focused on "what/why", not "how".
